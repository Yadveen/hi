	<h1 id="name">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</h1>
	<p class="maininfo">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (25 April/7 May 1840 - 25 October/6 November 1893), often anglicized as Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, was a Russian composer of the late-Romantic period, some of whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884, by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension.</p>

	<p class="maininfo">Tchaikovsky had 74 works published in his lifetime and 6 after he died. Here's a list of his most famous and interesting pieces...</p>
	<ol class="maininfo list">
	    <li>Two pieces for piano: Scherzo a la Russe and Impromptu, Op. 1. Tchaikovsky's first published pieces.</li>
		<li>Souvenir de Hapsal, 3 pieces for piano, Op.2. Tchaikovsky was inspired to write these works after a visit to the town of Hapsal with his brothers.</li>
		<li>String Quartet No. 1 in D Major, Op. 11. Tchaikovsky's first string quartet. The second movement is based on a folk melody the composer heard from a house painter.</li>
		<li>The Tempest, Op. 18. A soul-stirring Symphonic Poem based on Shakespeare's play. I think the love melody in this piece is even more moving than the famous Romeo and Juliet Overture love melody.</li>
